# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# Task.create(name: 'Buy coffee', priority: 1, complete: false)
# Task.create(name: 'Work on Angular Project', priority: 2, complete: false)
# Task.create(name: 'Exercise', priority: 3, complete: false)

# task_list = [
#   [ "Buy coffee", 1],
#   [ "Work on Angular Project", 2]
# ]
#
# task_list.each do |name, priority|
#   Task.create( name: name, priority: priority )
# end
